        <P id="h2"><b>1. Google’s Name Was Misspelled:</b>
It’s pretty hard to imagine the iconic brand being anything but “Google,” a word that didn’t exist until suddenly it did. Surprisingly, the real intention behind the search engine’s name is very meaningful. It was originally meant to be spelled “Googol”, which is a mathematical term. 
t refers to a number equal to 10 to the 100th power, which is to say, an unfathomable number. Pretty fitting for a site that can lead to an unimaginable number of pages. When the misspelling became apparent, the owners just went along with it. 
    </P>
<p id="h3"><b>2. People Read Screens Slower Than Physical Pages:</b>
It’s official — reading on a screen slows down your reading capability by 10%. Maybe this has something to do with light emissions or the fact that your blinking slows down from 20 to 7 times a minute when looking at a screen. Either way, if you need to get through some hefty reading fast, it might be worthwhile to just print it. </p>
